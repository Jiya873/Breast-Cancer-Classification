# Breast-Cancer-Classification
This project aims to classify breast cancer using a neural network model. The dataset used is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset from Kaggle

## Requirements

To run this notebook, you need the following libraries:

- numpy
- pandas
- kagglehub

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```sh
pip install numpy pandas kagglehub
```

## Dataset
The dataset is downloaded from Kaggle using the `kagglehub` library. The dataset contains features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image

## Usage
* Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory
* Open the `Breast_Cancer_Classification_with_NN.ipynb` notebook
* Run the cells in the notebook to download the dataset, preprocess the data, and train the neural network model
